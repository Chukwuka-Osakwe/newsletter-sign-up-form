## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Writing media queries is really really difficult. And I suspect that I could have probably avoided a number of the problems I ran into if I had simply embraced a mobile-first orientation to development. 

### Continued development

- Mobile-first development
- Writing media queries
- Working with images (surprised at how difficult this can get)

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Darryl Yeo. I got really stuck with the JS at some point and his looking over it was a big help.
